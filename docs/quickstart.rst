IPython Notebook Tutorials
==========================

Additional tutorials with more detailed examples are available as
IPython notebooks in the examples directory.

These notebooks can run interactively by running ``jupyter notebook`` in the examples directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd dmsky/examples
   $ jupyter notebook roster_example.ipynb

Note that this will require you to have both ipython and jupyter
installed in your python environment.  These can be installed in a
conda- or pip-based installation as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install with conda
   $ conda install ipython jupyter

   # Install with pip
   $ pip install ipython jupyter
